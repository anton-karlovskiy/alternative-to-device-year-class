# Demo: UA-aware code-splitting with React

A demo showing how to use UA-aware code-splitting with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Note: Device classification in this example is extremely basic. See [device-year-class](https://github.com/facebook/device-year-class) or explore custom device -> CPU mapping using a data-source like Geekbench for a production solution.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/anton-karlovskiy/alternative-to-device-year-class.git
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```
